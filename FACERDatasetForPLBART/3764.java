     * The type evaluator to be used when calculating the animated values of this animation.
     * The system will automatically assign a float or int evaluator based on the type
     * of <code>startValue</code> and <code>endValue</code> in the constructor. But if these values
     * are not one of these primitive types, or if different evaluation is desired (such as is
     * necessary with int values that represent colors), a custom evaluator needs to be assigned.
     * For example, when running an animation on color values, the {@link ArgbEvaluator}
     * should be used to get correct RGB color interpolation.
     *
     * <p>If this ValueAnimator has only one set of values being animated between, this evaluator
     * will be used for that set. If there are several sets of values being animated, which is
     * the case if PropertyValuesHOlder objects were set on the ValueAnimator, then the evaluator
     * is assigned just to the first PropertyValuesHolder object.</p>
     *
     * @param value the evaluator to be used this animation
