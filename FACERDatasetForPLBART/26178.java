     * Gets the size of the display, in pixels.
     * <p/>
     * Note that this value should not be used for computing layouts, since a
     * device will typically have screen decoration (such as a status bar) along
     * the edges of the display that reduce the amount of application space
     * available from the size returned here. Layouts should instead use the
     * window size.
     * <p/>
     * The size is adjusted based on the current rotation of the display.
     * <p/>
     * The size returned by this method does not necessarily represent the
     * actual raw size (native resolution) of the display. The returned size may
     * be adjusted to exclude certain system decoration elements that are always
     * visible. It may also be scaled to provide compatibility with older
     * applications that were originally designed for smaller displays.
     *
     * @param outSize null-ok. If it is null, will create a Point instance inside,
     *                otherwise use it to fill the output. NOTE if it is not null,
     *                it will be the returned value.
     * @return Screen size in pixels, the x is the width, the y is the height.
