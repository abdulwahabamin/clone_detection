     * starting value for the animation (unlike ObjectAnimator, which can derive that value
     * from the target object and property being animated). Therefore, there should typically
     * be two or more values.

     * @param values A set of values that the animation will animate between over time.
     * @return A ValueAnimator object that is set up to animate between the given values.
