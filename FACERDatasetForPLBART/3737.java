    /**
     * Constructs and returns a ValueAnimator that animates between Object values. A single
     * value implies that that value is the one being animated to. However, this is not typically
     * useful in a ValueAnimator object because there is no way for the object to determine the
     * starting value for the animation (unlike ObjectAnimator, which can derive that value
     * from the target object and property being animated). Therefore, there should typically
     * be two or more values.
     *
     * <p>Since ValueAnimator does not know how to animate between arbitrary Objects, this
     * factory method also takes a TypeEvaluator object that the ValueAnimator will use
     * to perform that interpolation.
     *
     * @param evaluator A TypeEvaluator that will be called on each animation frame to
     * provide the ncessry interpolation between the Object values to derive the animated
     * value.
     * @param values A set of values that the animation will animate between over time.
     * @return A ValueAnimator object that is set up to animate between the given values.
