     * Constructs and returns an ObjectAnimator that animates between Object values. A single

     * and ending values. More than two values imply a starting value, values to animate through
     * along the way, and an ending value (these values will be distributed evenly across
     * the duration of the animation).
     *
     * @param target The object whose property is to be animated. This object should
     * have a public method on it called <code>setName()</code>, where <code>name</code> is
     * the value of the <code>propertyName</code> parameter.
     * @param propertyName The name of the property being animated.
     * @param evaluator A TypeEvaluator that will be called on each animation frame to
     * provide the necessary interpolation between the Object values to derive the animated
     * value.
     * @param values A set of values that the animation will animate between over time.
     * @return An ObjectAnimator object that is set up to animate between the given values.
